	<h1>ABOUT US 
	<p>Founded in 1969 as a Silicon Valley start-up, the AMD <br>
	journey began with dozens of employees focused on <br>leading-edge semiconductor products. From those modest<br> beginnings, AMD has grown into a global company of 10,000 <br>
	people, achieving many important industry firsts along the<br> way. AMD today develops high-performance computing and <br>visualization products to solve some of the world’s toughest<br> and most interesting challenges. There has never been a<br>better time to be in the semiconductor industry, and we are<br> ready to tackle the next 50 years with high-performance<br> computing and graphics solutions that transform all of our lives.</p>

	  <p>It is a  x86-64 microprocessors designed and marketed by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) for desktop, mobile and embedded platforms based on the Zen microarchitecture and its successors. It consists of central processing units marketed for mainstream, enthusiast and workstation segments and accelerated processing units (APUs) marketed for mainstream and entry-level segments and embedded applications. Ryzen is especially significant for AMD, since it is a completely new design, and since it marks the corporation's return to the high end desktop CPU market.</p>
